- Develop accelerator toolkit - *David Sagan, Axel Huebl, Jean-Luc Vay*.

  - Integration, interfaces, tooling, continuous testing.
  - Compatibility and extensibility of large, complex simulation software (Similar to `ECP xSDK <http://xsdk.info>`_ but for acc. modeling)
- EVA (End-to-end Virtual Accelerator) - *Jean-Luc Vay, David Sagan*.
- Develop/integrate data standards & start-to-end workflows - *Axel Huebl, Jean-Luc Vay, David Sagan*.
